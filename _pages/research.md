My primary area of research is polarization studies using radio observations -- namely, looking at fast radio bursts, pulsars, and star forming regions.

Fast Radio Bursts
=====

Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are extragalactic, short duration radio transients that were first discovered in 2007. Since coming online in 2018, the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment ([CHIME](https://chime-experiment.ca/en); see the image by Andre Renard below) has detected thousands of FRBs, becoming the foremost observatory for FRB science. However, the local environments and emission mechanisms for producing FRBs remains elusive.

One aspect of my research focuses on studying the polarization properties of FRBs as a means to decipher their origins.
