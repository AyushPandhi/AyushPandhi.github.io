My primary area of research is polarization studies using radio observations -- namely, looking at fast radio bursts, pulsars, and star forming regions.

Origins of fast radio bursts
=====

Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are extragalactic, short duration radio transients that were first discovered in 2007. Since coming online in 2018, the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment ([CHIME](https://chime-experiment.ca/en); see the image by Andre Renard below) has detected thousands of FRBs, becoming the foremost observatory for FRB science. However, the local environments and emission mechanisms for producing FRBs remains elusive.

Many theories of FRB emission invoke a magnetar (a highly magnetized neturon star) origin -- as such, one aspect of my research focuses on studying the polarization properties of FRBs as a means to decipher their origins. For instance, the change in the polarization angle of the emitted light as a function of time and frequency can tell us about the region of the magnetosphere it was emitted from and the surrounding environment. I study these properties on a population level to determine if all FRBs originate from similar emission mechanisms and environments or whether there are multiple, distinct modes for producing FRBs. 

As the polarized radio emission from FRBs propagates from the source to us on Earth, the polarization angle of the radio waves is rotated by gas and magnetic fields in the intervening media (this effect is characterized by the "rotation measure" or "RM"). A large contribution to the RM is due to our own Galaxy and, therefore, to accurately study the magnetized environments around FRBs, we must have good estimates for the Milky Way's RM contribution within FRB observations. One way to do this is to use background, polarized light from many radio galaxies near the FRB on the sky and interpolate the RM at the sky-position of the FRB. I supervised a undergraduate research project (lead by Affan Khadir) to determine the best method for performing RM interpolation using extragalactic radio sources and will apply these methods to data collected using the Very Large Array ([VLA](https://public.nrao.edu/telescopes/vla/)) to remove the Milky Way RM contribution towards FRBs and better constrain their local magnetized media.

Fast radio bursts as probes of the Universe
=====

Regardless of the specific origins of FRBs, they serve as useful probes of intervening media because their signal is affected by the coincident gas and magnetic fields. In a [recent study](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.516.4739P/abstract), I showed that FRBs could be used to create a map of the thermal electrons in the Milky Way and of the Galactic magnetic field. In order to do this, we need to use statistical inference methods to recreate continuous fields from discrete lines of sight toward FRBs probing the Galaxy. Further, we also describe steps to help distinguish Galactic and extragalactic contributions to the observed FRB signal, which is one of the largest challenges when using FRBs to study intervening media. The figure below summarizes how well we can reconstruct the expected Galactic thermal electron distribution using 50,000 FRBs and applying some corrections that we derive.
