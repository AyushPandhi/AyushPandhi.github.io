I'm very passionate about science outreach and teaching astronomy. During my time as a PhD student, I've been a teaching assistant for six different courses spanning a range of audiences and 
expertise levels (from introductory courses for non-astronomy majors to in depth astronomy specialist courses). In some of these courses I have helped develop the content for, and taught, tutorials
for classes with ~100 students.

Outreach
=====

Over the last 6 years in Toronto, I have been involved in many different astronomy outreach initiatives and have coordinated dozens of educational events. Some of these initatives include:

1. The Astronomy and Space Exploration Society ([ASX](http://asx.sa.utoronto.ca/)),

2. Science Rendezvous U of T ([SR UofT](http://www.sciencerendezvousuoft.ca/)),

3. Astro Tours ([AstroTours](https://www.astro.utoronto.ca/astrotours/)).

I have also given multiple talks and interviews within the department, at schools across Canada, and for papers/radio/television focusing on the importance of communicating astronomy research and how
to succeed in the academic environment of astrophysics.

Mentorship
=====

I developed and conducted the graduate -- undergraduate student mentorship program within my department to help upper year undergraduate students navigate the transition to graduate programs and/or 
industry. This program has been successfully running in the department since Fall 2020 and has ~50 participants per year. I myself have also directly mentored three students as a part of the program.
