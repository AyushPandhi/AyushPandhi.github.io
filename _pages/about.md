I'm a 3rd year PhD candidate and NSERC CGS-D scholar in the David A. Dunlap Department of Astronomy and Astrophysics at the University of Toronto. Priot to that, I completed an Honours Bachelor of Science, specializing in Astronomy and Astrophysics, from Victoria College at the University of Toronto.

My research focuses on understanding the role of magnetic fields on all scales in the Universe using radio wavelength observations. As a part of the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment fast radio burst (CHIME/FRB) project, I'm interested in using the polarization properties of FRBs to elucidate their emission mechanisms and host environments and also to use FRBs as probes of Galactic and intergalactc magnetic fields. A heavy focus of my work is to incorporate cutting edge statistical inference methods in order to reconstruct continuous magnetic field structure from discrete, noisy observations.

Another avenue of research that I'm interested in is the role of magnetic fields in the process of star formation. Using dust polarization, we can trace the orientation of the local Galactic magnetic field in the plane of the sky and study how it aligns with the morphology and rotation of dense molecular cores (the progenitors of stars). 

In the tab above, you can find more information about my research, a list of my publications, student projects that I've supervisied, teaching and outreach, and you can download my curriculum vitae.
